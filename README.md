NBA Live Stats in Tables

I have a strange habit to listen to NBA live streams on nba.com while doing something else on my laptop. In order to stay updated with latest results I have to click through all active games in order to check the stats and usually get lost in sudden burst of numbers and stats. So I decided to make custom NBA Live Stats scripts to get the preferred stats with only one click (one script execution). This repository is a collection of such live stats scripts all resulting in drawing a table in terminal with most interesting stats for that evening.
